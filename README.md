# Labs of MIT 6.S081 Fall 2020

These are my solutions to the labs for the [xv6 course at
MIT](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2020/labs/). They should pass all the
make grades in each branch.

This being a personal project in my free time (I am not a CS student) some code
is quite hideous probably and badly optimized, but I was of the stance that if
it works and I understand why it works it's fine, I am not trying to make a
usable OS out of xv6 but get the basics of OS programming down.

For discussions of the solutions sometimes the commit messages contain my view
on my commits, view them with git log. These are mostly my own solutions,
unless otherwise indicated in the commit messages (which is only the case
for the pagetbl lab IIRC in which I had a bug I couldn't
solve for a few days and resolved to looking up my problem).
