I know that my solution to this lab is an absolute mess, but it's honest work.

I was not quite sure what was meant with the VMA and I don't understand how it
was intended that one could just have a fixed size array with each process
since upon unmapping a vma its area is freed again so one needs to keep track
of the free and the unfree areas.

Otherwise if you just have a fixed size list you can keep a global counter that
keeps going down (towards myproc()->sz) where you start you VMA, that certainly
works with mmaptest but seems like a suboptimal solution.

I say that fully knowing that I am not taking the best approach either, instead
of merging neighbouring free VMA I just let them fracture further and further,
but I was too lazy to implement that check as well, it passes the test and in
principle the rest to make it pretty should be rather easy but that additional
hour or so I do not want to put into this lab.
